Triangle

problem: a, b, c is given. Can we make a triangel out of it?

solution: if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a then possible.

problem: (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) is given. what is the area of it?

solution: area = 0.5 * | (x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) - (x3 - x1) * (y2 - y1)|

          if area > 0.0 then triangle is possible
